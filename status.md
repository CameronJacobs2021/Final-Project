#### What have you done for your project so far?

Most of the project is done such as successfully rendering the desired player and map onto the screen and getting the player to move successfully. We also are able to display victory/loser messages upon specific collisions. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Some fine tuning such as getting the screen to change upon collision from below correctly, fixing some small glitches that are a result of screen clearing, and some other stuff me may have not thouhgt of yet. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

We encountered the following problems so far:
1~ Getting the sprite to correctly display with the movement
2~ Getting the collisions to work correctly for the new sprite
3~ Getting the screen to display a message upon collision with certain objects
4~ Getting the screen to display the message in the correct position upon collision with certain objects
5~ getting the sprite to display the message upon collision from the bottom of the sprite
