# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Hopefully: 'G.O.A.T'

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

It will be a gam where a goat jumps over obstacles.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will create a game with objects and allow the user to play. Features include a character, objects, a map, music, and hopefully animation

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Suraiya Shoyab; tul60739@temple.edu; Tamara Katic

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### No matter what, we will accomplish a background, music, and a moving character

TODO

### A better outcome would be that we get the character to do what we want and it is the actual character we want, along wiht animation involved in movement

TODO

### A fully completed game: plays the music we want, the character moves how we want when walking; it jumps over obstacles; it gets harder as time goes on; and there is a loser message at the end. Basically a fully functioning game

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The skills we would need to aquire is how to use other spritemaps to get other characters on our game along with other tiles. We would also need to know how to get a looping or continuous scrolling screen so that we can keep playing. We would also need to know how to use music from other sources so that we can put it in our code. Some research will most likely be done through google and youtube. We will all take apart in that. A lot of the code will be heavily influenced by the already existing mario code.
